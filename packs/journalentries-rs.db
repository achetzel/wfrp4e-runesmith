RUNECRAFT</h2>\n<p>Runesmiths follow a litany of rules laid down by their guild. Some of these rules exist for practical reasons, while others are simply tradition. The following \"Rules of Runecraft\" govern the creation of runic items of all types.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Form</h3>\n<p>Runes must be inscribed on items of the appropriate type. Armor runes must be inscribed on armor, weapon runes on weapons, talismanic runes on rings, amulets, etc. Furthermore, runes must be carved, so the chosen items must be made of a resilient substance. Metal, wood, bone, and stone are appropriate, for example, while paper, leather, and ceramic are not. Last, items that bear runes must be well made. Temporary runes can on be inscribed on items of Good or Best craftmanship, and permanent runes can only be inscribed on items of Best craftmanship.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Three</h3>\n<p>A single item can only contain so much magical power. Thus no runic item can have more than three runes inscribed on it at any given time. Any attempts to add a fourth on an item automatically fails. The same rune cannot be inscribed more than once on a single item.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Mastery</h3>\n<p>Master runes are too powerful to be combined with any other runes. If an item is inscribed with a master rune, it can bear no other runes of any kind. Runesmiths refer to master runes as \"jealous runes\" for this reason.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Pride</h3>\n<p>Runesmiths take pride in their craft. They don't like to repeat themselves, and they are always looking to create greater and greater masterworks. Except under unusual circumstances (Alaric the Mad forging the Runefangs, for example.), a Runesmith will never create a copy of a runic item he's made.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Time</h3>\n<p>When working on a rune item, a Runesmith must dedicate the majority of his time to the job and can only work on one rune at a time. A Runesmith must spend at least four hours each day working on the rune for the day to count in the creation process. If no work is done on a rune for over one month, the attempt fails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"border:none\">CRAFTING A RUNE</h2>\n<p>A Runesmith that meets the criteria can attempt to create magical runes. The basic process for creating temporary and permanent runes is the same; only the amount of time differs.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Step 1: Inscription</h3>\n<p>At the start of the process, the Runesmith must inscribe the chosen rune on the item to be enchanted. This must be done with extreme care, as the tiniest imperfections can create a fatal flaw. Inscription takes 2d10 minutes for temporary runes and 1 week for permanent runes. At the end of this time, an Inscription Roll is made. The Runesmith rolls a number of d10s equal to his Inscribe Rune talent level and adds them together. If the result of the Inscription Roll is equal to or greater than the Inscription Number of the rune, it is created successfully. If the Inscription Roll is lower than the Inscription Number of the rune, the attempt fails, and the time spent is wasted. Unlike spellcasting, there is no danger of Tzeentch's Curse.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Step 2: Empowering</h3>\n<p>Once the rune is successfully inscribed, it must be empowered. This is the lengthiest part of the process. The Runesmith uses runic chants and other ritualized methods to instill the rune with magic. Empowering is resolved as an Extended Empower Rune Skill test. Each test takes 20 minutes for a temporary rune and one month for a permanent rune. Each rune requires a certain number of successes to empower (see the individual rune descriptions). Once the Runesmith achieves the specific number of successes, the item is ready for binding.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Step 3: Binding</h3>\n<p>Once the rune is empowered, the Runesmith needs to perform a few final rituals to bind the magic into the rune. The final step takes 1d10 minutes for temporary runes and 1d10 days for permanent runes. Only after the binding is complete is the rune's power activated and the item considered magical.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"jzYWUlc06lnjGdA4":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.szXVdjJEffaA6Fxj"}}}

{"_id":"szXVdjJEffaA6Fxj","name":"Runesmith","content":"<h1>RUNESMITH</h1>\n<p>The Runesmiths are effectively a clan containing a few ancient families who have passed down the knowledge and skills of Runesmithing over the generations. Each Master Runesmith teaches the fundamentals of fire and forge to young members of his family, selecting the most talented to become Apprentice Runesmiths. While selection is a great honor, it means long years of study and service to his master in the creation of more complicated runes. Runesmiths rarely write down the secrets of their craft and even when they do, the knowledge is buried beneath riddles and puzzles.</p>\n<p>At some point in their career Runesmiths are expected to venture out into the world in search of ancient magical treasures to bring back for study. Furthermore, these Dwarfs must take their accumulated knowledge and learn additional Runes from their independent study and experimentation.</p>\n<p>Runesmiths are the teachers and keepers of Rune knowledge. Many Runesmiths will stay in their hold, passing on what they have learned to the young and talented Dwarfs in their family. Other Runesmiths devote years of their lives to the search of ancient secrets, exploring the world to uncover ancient weapons and artifacts of great age, hoping to recover lost Runes of ancient and fabled Runesmiths. Such quests take Runesmiths into dangerous places, such as ruined holds, dragon lairs, the depths of Elven forests, and worse, for much in the Dwarfs territory has, over the centuries, fallen into the hands of their enemies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Class: </strong>Academic</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Runesmith Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table border=\"\\&quot;1\\&quot;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr

RUNECRAFT</h2>\n<p>Runesmiths follow a litany of rules laid down by their guild. Some of these rules exist for practical reasons, while others are simply tradition. The following \"Rules of Runecraft\" govern the creation of runic items of all types.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Form</h3>\n<p>Runes must be inscribed on items of the appropriate type. Armor runes must be inscribed on armor, weapon runes on weapons, talismanic runes on rings, amulets, etc. Furthermore, runes must be carved, so the chosen items must be made of a resilient substance. Metal, wood, bone, and stone are appropriate, for example, while paper, leather, and ceramic are not. Last, items that bear runes must be well made. Temporary runes can on be inscribed on items of Good or Best craftmanship, and permanent runes can only be inscribed on items of Best craftmanship.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Three</h3>\n<p>A single item can only contain so much magical power. Thus no runic item can have more than three runes inscribed on it at any given time. Any attempts to add a fourth on an item automatically fails. The same rune cannot be inscribed more than once on a single item.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Mastery</h3>\n<p>Master runes are too powerful to be combined with any other runes. If an item is inscribed with a master rune, it can bear no other runes of any kind. Runesmiths refer to master runes as \"jealous runes\" for this reason.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Pride</h3>\n<p>Runesmiths take pride in their craft. They don't like to repeat themselves, and they are always looking to create greater and greater masterworks. Except under unusual circumstances (Alaric the Mad forging the Runefangs, for example.), a Runesmith will never create a copy of a runic item he's made.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Rule of Time</h3>\n<p>When working on a rune item, a Runesmith must dedicate the majority of his time to the job and can only work on one rune at a time. A Runesmith must spend at least four hours each day working on the rune for the day to count in the creation process. If no work is done on a rune for over one month, the attempt fails.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"border:none\">CRAFTING A RUNE</h2>\n<p>A Runesmith that meets the criteria can attempt to create magical runes. The basic process for creating temporary and permanent runes is the same; only the amount of time differs.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Step 1: Inscription</h3>\n<p>At the start of the process, the Runesmith must inscribe the chosen rune on the item to be enchanted. This must be done with extreme care, as the tiniest imperfections can create a fatal flaw. Inscription takes 2d10 minutes for temporary runes and 1 week for permanent runes. At the end of this time, an Inscription Roll is made. The Runesmith rolls a number of d10s equal to his Inscribe Rune talent level and adds them together. If the result of the Inscription Roll is equal to or greater than the Inscription Number of the rune, it is created successfully. If the Inscription Roll is lower than the Inscription Number of the rune, the attempt fails, and the time spent is wasted. Unlike spellcasting, there is no danger of Tzeentch's Curse.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Step 2: Empowering</h3>\n<p>Once the rune is successfully inscribed, it must be empowered. This is the lengthiest part of the process. The Runesmith uses runic chants and other ritualized methods to instill the rune with magic. Empowering is resolved as an Extended Empower Rune Skill test. Each test takes 20 minutes for a temporary rune and one month for a permanent rune. Each rune requires a certain number of successes to empower (see the individual rune descriptions). Once the Runesmith achieves the specific number of successes, the item is ready for binding.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight:bold\">Step 3: Binding</h3>\n<p>Once the rune is empowered, the Runesmith needs to perform a few final rituals to bind the magic into the rune. The final step takes 1d10 minutes for temporary runes and 1d10 days for permanent runes. Only after the binding is complete is the rune's power activated and the item considered magical.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"jzYWUlc06lnjGdA4":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.szXVdjJEffaA6Fxj"}}}
